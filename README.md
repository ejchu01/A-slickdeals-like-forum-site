# A-slickdeals-like-forum-site
I'm pretty much a fan of slick deals and I got a bunch of deal there. I feel like it'd be fascinating to build a deal collection site like that on my own. Let's get started!

## Forum
I'll start from building a forum with basic users, threads and replies.

The demo website is online at [www.borei-coding-land](http://www.borei-coding-land.com/threads "fake slick deals site")
You are welcomed to try it out and raise issue. Though it is crude and simple.
Right now 
1. supports user login, posts, categories, comments.
2. supports hot deals, personal posts, vote up and down.
3. supports user profile page, including posted threads and activities.

### More features are coming!
